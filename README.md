# 16-811
Assignments for Math Fundamentals for Robotics (16-811) @CMU

All the assignments are solved using MATLAB (R2081_a) or Python 3.6.5 (Anaconda Distribution). 

If you are currently taking the 16-811 course, I encourage you to try the assignments on your own and preferably not use the code snippets here - since this is a violation of the academic integrity policy of the institute.  

If you are here for learning different concepts, please go ahead and refer any snippets.

### Assignment 1 - Linear Algebra (Practicum, MATLAB)
### Assignment 2 - Interpolation, Root finding (Practicum, MATLAB)
### Assignment 3 - Function Approximation (Practicum, Python)
### Assignment 4 - Differential Equations, Optimization (Practicum, Python, MATLAB)
### Assignment 5 - Calculus of Variations (Theory)
